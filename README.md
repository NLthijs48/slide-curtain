# Home-Assistant Custom Component for Slide

This custom component home-assistant (http://www.home-assistant.io) can control the Slide (https://slide.store).

## Slide

### Requirements
- Home Assistant 0.94+

### Custom Component vs Integration

The `slide` integration is included into the Home Assistant and it is based on this custom component. The custom component will contain newer features then the standard integrated one, until it is hopefully merged into Home Assistant. At this moment the local API will only be available in the custom component. Also Home Assistant dictates that integrations should move to the GUI integration instead of the YAML file, which is difficult/impossible with the local API configuration.

### Installation

- Copy directory `slide` `<config dir>/custom_components` directory.
- Configure with config below.
- Restart Home-Assistant.

### Usage
To use this component in your installation for the Cloud API, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
